# ROP
Sample solution with ROP functions, this is a companion for this [blog post](https://davidelettieri.it/rop/'tagged/union'/'railway/oriented/programming'/c%23/2020/04/04/railway-oriented-programming-with-c.html)

I tried to implement some of the functions described by SW on his website at [ROP](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/). I did some changes to adjust to my own code style such as the `Then` extension methods.
